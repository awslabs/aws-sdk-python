# What is the experimental Amazon Bedrock Runtime client for Python?<a name="what-is-the-python-sdk"></a>

Welcome to the experimental Amazon Bedrock Runtime client for Python, a new [Smithy](https://smithy.io/)-based SDK that lets Python developers create applications that use Amazon Bedrock Runtime. 

**Important**  
The experimental Amazon Bedrock Runtime client for Python is an experimental async Python SDK that allows developers to take advantage of Amazon Bedrock Runtime. It is currently in early stages of development. **There are likely to be breaking changes** during this phase of the SDK's development.

**Note**  
Currently, the only service supported by this package is Amazon Bedrock Runtime. To access other services, use the current AWS SDK for Python, [Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/index.html).  
You can use Boto3 and the experimental Amazon Bedrock Runtime client for Python together to create comprehensive Python applications that access AWS services.
